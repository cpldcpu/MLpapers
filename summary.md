#### Averaging Weights Leads to Wider Optima and Better Generalization

*Pavel Izmailov, Dmitrii Podoprikhin, Timur Garipov, Dmitry Vetrov, Andrew Gordon Wilson*

**Summary:** Deep neural networks are typically trained by optimizing a loss function with an SGD variant, in conjunction with a decaying learning rate, until convergence. We show that simple averaging of multiple points along the trajectory of SGD, with a cyclical or constant learning rate, leads to better generalization than conventional training.

We demonstrate two novel and surprising behaviours: ungrokking, in which a network regresses from perfect to low test accuracy, and semi-grokking, in which a network shows delayed generalisation to partial rather than perfect test accuracy.

**Summary:** Recent research, such as BitNet [ WMD+23], is paving the way for a new era of 1- bit Large Language Models (LLMs). In this work, we introduce a 1-bit LLM variant, namely BitNet b1.58 , in which every single parameter (or weight) of the LLM is ternary {-1, 0, 1}. It matches the full-precision (i.e., FP16 or BF16) Transformer LLM with the same model size and training tokens in terms of both perplexity and end-task performance, while being significantly more cost-effective in terms of latency, memory, throughput, and energy consumption.

#### Visual Autoregressive Modeling: Scalable Image Generation via Next-Scale Prediction

*Keyu Tian, Yi Jiang, Zehuan Yuan, Bingyue Peng, Liwei Wang*

**Summary:** We present Visual AutoRegressive modeling (V AR), a new generation paradigm that redefines the autoregressive learning on images as coarse-to-fine "next-scale prediction" or "next-resolution prediction", diverging from the standard raster-scan "next-token prediction". This simple, intuitive methodology allows autoregressive (AR) transformers to learn visual distributions fast and can generalize well: V AR, for the first time , makes GPT-style AR models surpass diffusion transformers in image generation.

#### Physics of Language Models: Part 3.3 Knowledge Capacity Scaling Laws

*Zeyuan Allen-Zhu, Yuanzhi Li*

**Summary:** Scaling laws describe the relationship between the size of language models and their capabilities. Unlike prior studies that evaluate a model's capability via loss or benchmarks, we estimate the number of knowledge bits a model stores.

#### Grokked Transformers are Implicit Reasoners: A Mechanistic Journey to the Edge of Generalization

*Boshi Wang, Xiang Yue, Yu Su, Huan Sun*

**Summary:** We study whether transformers can learn to implicitly reason over parametric knowledge, a skill that even the most capable language models struggle with. Focusing on two representative reasoning types, composition and comparison, we consistently find that transformers canlearn implicit reasoning, but only through grokking , i.e., extended training far beyond overfitting.

#### No Free Prune: Information-Theoretic Barriers to Pruning at Initialization

*Tanishq Kumar, Kevin Luo, Mark Sellke*

**Summary:** The existence of lottery tickets Frankle & Carbin (2018) at or near initialization raises the tantalizing question of whether large models are necessary in deep learning, or whether sparse networks can be quickly identified and trained without ever training the dense models that contain them. However, efforts to find these sparse subnetworks without training the dense model ('pruning at initialization') have been broadly unsuccessful Frankle et al. (2020b).
